- add link to API specification if missing or invalid
- add/edit library
- anything else, really...

# Who can add new APIs?
Anyone can add or suggest changes to an API

# What kind of APIs can be added?
Publicly available APIs of any kind (paid or free)

# Should I make changes in *.md files directly?
No, they are generated from templates and APIs database `apis.yaml`.

So, if you want to make changes in `README.md`, make changes in `templates`. 
If you want to modify api's data, make changes in `apis.yaml`

# APIs to add
Search for issues with labels ["help wanted" and "new api"](https://github.com/apis-list/apis-list/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"new+api"+label%3A"new+api"). These list one of more APIs that should be added.

# Does API definition has schema?
Yes, it has - [schema.json](https://github.com/apis-list/apis-list/blob/main/schema.json)
