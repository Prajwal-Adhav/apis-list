# Who can add new APIs?
Anyone can add or suggest changes to an API

# What kind of APIs can be added?
Publicly available APIs of any kind (paid or free)

# Should I make changes in *.md files directly?
No, they are generated from templates and APIs database `apis.yaml`.

So, if you want to make changes in `README.md`, make changes in `templates`. 
If you want to modify api's data, make changes in `apis.yaml`
