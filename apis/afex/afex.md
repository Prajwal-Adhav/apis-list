Never worry about maintaining API documentation again. AFEX API is designed for businesses that want to make frequent payments.  By accessing our Payment Engine via our API, it allows customers to automate their end-to-end payment processes and rapidly deliver tailor-made solutions for our customers’ business directly. Payments are sent through AFEX’s intermediary banks, payment channels and are bound by applicable laws, regulations, clearing house rules or payment processing procedures.  The Postman Documenter generates and maintains beautiful, live documentation for your collections
