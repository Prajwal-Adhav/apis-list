REST and GraphQL framework on top of Symfony and React. API Platform is a PHP framework for API-first projects built on top of Symfony.  Just like the other modern frameworks such as Zend and Symfony, it is both a full stack all-in-one framework and a set of independent PHP components and bundles that can be used separately. It allows to create modern and powerful Web APIs in a few minutes with total freedom in terms of redefinition and customization. It is compliant with the latest generation of standards and usages and supports Linked Data, HATEOAS and the semantic Web (JSON-LD, Hydra, Schema.org, JWT…)
