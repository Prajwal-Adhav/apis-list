DeepCode is advanced AI Software Platform that learns from all open-source developers and uses the acquired knowledge to make real-time suggestions on how your code can be improved.
DeepCode understands the intent and semantic function of software code by transforming the code into a language-independent Graph Index representing all semantic facts that are analyzed against the knowledge of the global development community. Our Symbolic AI Software Platform continuously learns from BigCode the latest standards, historical fixes, solutions, and know-how from the global software development community and provides powerful real-time tools and suggestions to software developers.
