# IBM Visual Recognition


The IBM Watson Visual Recognition service uses deep learning algorithms to identify scenes and objects in images that you upload to the service. You can create and train a custom classifier to identify subjects that suit your needs. Existing instances are supported until 1 December 2021, but as of 7 January 2021, you can't create instances.  Any instance that is provisioned on 1 December 2021 will be deleted. IBM Watso Visual Recognition is discontinued
