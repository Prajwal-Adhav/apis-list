# Unofficial Google News Api

GNews is an API to search for articles from a variety of sources, including Google News.  We also provide top headlines from which you can filter by topic such as world, business, sports. The Unofficial Google News API is used for collecting articles corresponding to a given set of keywords. The API was created as a reliable alternative in response to Google's closure of their Google News API. Our API allows you to receive up to 100 articles per search (max item number depends on your plan). Each article contains a title, a description, the article link, the website, the source and the date
