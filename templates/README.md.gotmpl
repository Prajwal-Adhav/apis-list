# List of Public APIs
This project is an attempt to categorise and compile information about different public APIs into one place. Its goal is to build
most complete and handy list which will help developers to find APIs most suitable for their needs.
It includes APIs description, links to docs, specification, list of SDK and libraries, logo etc.

This list intended to be maintained by wide open source community, so any contributions appreciated.
If you want to add/edit/remove/etc APIs from this list, please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/apis-list/apis-list/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
